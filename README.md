## Lab 2
<b>
  Find the height of a target object given the height of a query
object.
  
1. Finding vanishing points within an image using RANSAC.
2. Obtain affine 3D measurements from a vanishing line and vanishing point.
</b>

## Lab 3
<b>Perform structure from motion and bundle adjustment to
simultaneously obtain extrinsic camera parameters i.e. poses and perform 3D reconstruction.</b>

## Lab 4
<b>Compute a dense 3D model from multi-view stereo, i.e. the plane sweeping
algorithm.</b>
